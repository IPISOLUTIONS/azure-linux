There are tons of Linux distributions, usually broken down by the package management systems: Some are dpkg-based, like Debian and Ubuntu, and others are rpm-based, like CentOS, SUSE, and RedHat. Some companies provide distro images as formal partners of Microsoft and are endorsed. Others are provided by the community. The distros in this section have formal articles about them, even if they were only used in examples of other technologies.

### [Ubuntu](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/Canonical/)

Community images
----------------

Community images are Linux images pre-configured for specific purposes, that can be used to create Azure Virtual Machines. For example, you might find a version of Ubuntu with the LAMP or MEAN stack already installed.

The Docker Hub Repository serves a similar purpose, just for Docker images.

-	[MSOpenTech VM Depot](https://vmdepot.msopentech.com/List/Index) &mdash; for community provided virtual machine images.

-	[Docker Hub Registry](https://registry.hub.docker.com/) &mdash; the registry for Docker container images.
